# Design rationale

Why each rule is scoped as it is. Every decision below was forced by a real
failure - reasoning from first principles produced the wrong answer at least
three times, so the incidents are recorded alongside the rules.

## Architecture: fat script, thin subagent, validator gates the commit

```
/extant
   |  the invoking session writes a friction summary from its own context
   v
subagent
   |
   +- 1. extant_collect.py --collect   -> bundle.json   (facts, no prose)
   +- 2. drafts the entry from the bundle
   +- 3. extant_collect.py --archive   (AFTER drafting; see below)
   +- 4. extant_collect.py --validate  -> exit 0/1
   +- 5. commits ONLY if step 4 exits 0
```

Steps 1, 3 and 4 are deterministic Python. Step 2 is the only LLM step.

**Why archiving is script-side:** asking a model to rewrite a 1,800-line file is
asking it to silently drop content. Splitting on header boundaries is trivial
deterministic text surgery, and it can assert conservation.

**Why the friction summary comes from the parent:** the session that experienced
the friction is the only thing that knows it. Mining transcript files couples the
tool to an undocumented internal format.

## The core guarantee

**No rule inspects numbers or dates.** Historical facts ("the suite was 2238 at
release 3") are true when written and never re-checked. This is structural: no
rule exists that could flag them.

Adding a numeric cross-check is the most tempting available mistake. It looks
helpful, and it reintroduces the false-positive class that makes a validator get
ignored. Every rule must be falsifiable against git or the filesystem.

## Adding a rule

Rules live in a registry in `extant_collect.py`. Each declares what it emits,
its scope, whether it survives archiving, and - required - the exact yes/no
question it asks of git or the filesystem:

```python
Rule(
    kind="false-merge-claim",
    check=validate_merge_claims,
    scope="whole-file",
    in_archive=True,
    falsifiable="is the claimed commit an ancestor of trunk?",
)
```

**The admission test:** a rule belongs only if it can be answered yes/no by git
or the filesystem, AND produces zero false positives on the real corpus. A test
enforces the first half - every rule must state its question - so a rule that
inspects numbers or dates cannot be added quietly. The second half is on you:
measure before you write the pattern.

Candidates that would pass: release-tag claims (does the tag exist and is it on
trunk?), branch existence (a branch named in prose but absent - currently a real
gap), deletion claims (does the file still exist?), ordering claims (git
ancestry).

Candidates that would fail, and why: suite-count consistency and date validity
are numbers, which is the forbidden class; issue and PR links need the network,
breaking the deterministic-local guarantee; "does this summary match the diff"
is judgement, not falsifiable.

`validate(repo, text, in_archive=...)` iterates the registry. The caller says
what the document IS and the registry decides which rules follow - replacing a
`check_live_claims` boolean that forced every caller to know the rule list and
would have needed a second boolean for the next rule.

## Rule scoping, and why each answer differs

### Live claims - newest entry only

First version checked the whole file and fired on an entry that honestly stated
its own past status was "retained as written history". That is a false positive
on self-describing prose, and it is how a validator loses trust.

Narrowing to the newest entry is principled, not a patch: a present-tense status
is only meaningful for the current entry. Older entries are historical by
construction.

**Second half of the same fix:** the rule originally required the named branch to
BOTH exist and be merged. Projects that delete branches after merging made the
motivating defect - a false "not yet merged" about shipped work - structurally
undetectable. A claim naming a branch that no longer exists is now flagged too.

### Merge claims - whole file, including the archive

The opposite scope, for a real reason. "Merged at X" is a permanent claim about
the past: it should hold in any entry at any age. A stale "still outstanding"
claim costs a reader redundant work; a false "merged" claim tells them work
landed when it did not, so they build on nothing.

Archiving does not make a false factual claim true, so the archive is checked.

### Path pointers - operative use only

Measured before implementing: **23 of 88 path-shaped tokens did not exist, and
all 23 were legitimate** - completed-phase layout descriptions, deferred work
never built, files explicitly described as deleted. A shape-keyed rule would have
emitted 23 false positives on its first run.

Keyed on operative markers (`Plan:`, `Design:`, `see`, `read`) it emits none, and
still catches the defect that motivated it.

### References - whole file, backticked and bare

A dead reference is worthless regardless of age. Both styles must be checked:
a whole-branch review found 14 dead **bare** SHAs in documents the validator had
already certified clean, because only backticked tokens were being examined.

**Detection and repair must use the same tokenizer.** They did not, once: the
validator scanned per line while the translator scanned whole-text, and because
backticks pair across newlines the two drifted out of phase on **402 tokens**.
The validator reported dead SHAs the repairer was structurally unable to fix.

## Known limits, found by adversarial probing

An adversarial pass, now 18 probes wide, leaves three standing. They are
recorded because an undisclosed limit is indistinguishable from an unknown one:
the harness prints each of these as a flagged observation on every run, and a
flag with nothing written down here would read as a fresh defect every time.

**Claim deletion passes.** The validator compares claims against git; it cannot
compare a document against its own previous version. Deleting the offending
sentence is therefore always a way through. Mitigated only at the workflow
level, by the anti-gaming rules below.

**A user-supplied regex can hang.** Configuration accepts patterns, and Python's
`re` has no timeout, so a catastrophically backtracking pattern spins. The blast
radius is the author's own repository and the fix is to simplify the pattern,
but a hang is a worse failure mode than an error and is worth knowing about.

**A consistency check can name the same file twice and always agree.** The
check rejects a single-file block, because comparing a file against itself
proves nothing, and it normalises paths so `docs/x.md` and `docs/./x.md` are
caught as one file under two spellings. What it cannot catch is the same file
reached by genuinely different routes, a symlink or a case variant on a
case-insensitive filesystem. Such a block passes forever while appearing to
compare two things. The two-file minimum catches the obvious shape and not this
one.

**Fenced code is exempt from claim rules but not from the secret scan.** These
pull in opposite directions on purpose. An example in a fence is not a promise,
so claims there are ignored; a credential in a fence is still committed, so the
secret scan reads everything. Inline backticks are treated differently again:
kept for claim rules, because claims are written inside them, and blanked for
link rules, because an example link is written inside them too.

## Anti-gaming

**The subagent gets at most 2 validation attempts and must report its FIRST-run
findings even if a later attempt cleared them.** Without this, the cheapest way
to pass a validator is to delete the offending claim. With it, claim-deletion is
visible in both the report and the diff.

**A red test suite must not block the status commit.** An entry that can only
describe green states withholds the truth exactly when it matters most.

**The archive must be validated.** Otherwise `--archive` shrinks the validation
surface and the tool passes its own gate by relocating content - the same defect
as a subagent deleting a claim, committed by the tool itself.

## Archive ordering

Archive **after** drafting the new entry, not before. Archiving first means the
new entry does not count toward the retention cap, so the document holds one more
entry than allowed and the archive runs permanently one cycle behind.

That fix immediately exposed the next one: the newly-archived entry then tripped
the live-claim rule, because "newest entry" in the archive is simply the most
recently retired one. Hence the archive's exemption from live-claim checking, and
only that rule.

## Conservation

The archive split is the only irreversible file operation. It asserts line
conservation with **multiset** arithmetic, not set membership - a set check
cannot detect the loss of a duplicated line, because one surviving copy satisfies
it.

The baseline for that check is the raw file bytes, **not** a reassembly of the
splitter's own output. Deriving it from the splitter makes the check circular: a
bug in the splitter corrupts both sides equally and they always agree.

## Authoring constraints these rules impose

- **Paraphrase past statuses in the newest entry; never quote or strike them
  through.** The rules cannot distinguish a quotation from a claim.
- Write SHA ranges as `` `a` `` -> `` `b` ``, not `` `a -> b` ``. A range inside one
  backtick pair is not recognised as a reference and escapes both checking and
  repair.
- Give each entry the exact configured header. A wrong header silently disables
  archiving and live-claim validation for that entry.

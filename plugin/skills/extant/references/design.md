# Design rationale

Why each rule is scoped as it is. Every decision below was forced by a real
failure - reasoning from first principles produced the wrong answer at least
three times, so the incidents are recorded alongside the rules.

## Architecture: fat script, thin subagent, validator gates the commit

```
/extant
   |  the invoking session writes a friction summary from its own context
   v
subagent
   |
   +- 1. extant_collect.py --collect   -> bundle.json   (facts, no prose)
   +- 2. drafts the entry from the bundle
   +- 3. extant_collect.py --archive   (AFTER drafting; see below)
   +- 4. extant_collect.py --validate  -> exit 0/1
   +- 5. commits ONLY if step 4 exits 0
```

Steps 1, 3 and 4 are deterministic Python. Step 2 is the only LLM step.

**Why archiving is script-side:** asking a model to rewrite a 1,800-line file is
asking it to silently drop content. Splitting on header boundaries is trivial
deterministic text surgery, and it can assert conservation.

**Why the friction summary comes from the parent:** the session that experienced
the friction is the only thing that knows it. Mining transcript files couples the
tool to an undocumented internal format.

## The core guarantee

**No rule inspects numbers or dates.** Historical facts ("the suite was 2238 at
release 3") are true when written and never re-checked. This is structural: no
rule exists that could flag them.

Adding a numeric cross-check is the most tempting available mistake. It looks
helpful, and it reintroduces the false-positive class that makes a validator get
ignored. Every rule must be falsifiable against git or the filesystem.

## Adding a rule

Rules live in a registry in `extant_collect.py`. Each declares what it emits,
its scope, whether it survives archiving, and - required - the exact yes/no
question it asks of git or the filesystem:

```python
Rule(
    kind="false-merge-claim",
    check=validate_merge_claims,
    scope="whole-file",
    in_archive=True,
    falsifiable="is the claimed commit an ancestor of the ref the claim names?",
)
```

**The admission test:** a rule belongs only if it can be answered yes/no by git
or the filesystem, AND produces zero false positives on the real corpus. A test
enforces the first half - every rule must state its question - so a rule that
inspects numbers or dates cannot be added quietly. The second half is on you:
measure before you write the pattern.

Candidates that would pass: release-tag claims (does the tag exist and is it on
trunk?), branch existence (a branch named in prose but absent - currently a real
gap), deletion claims (does the file still exist?), ordering claims (git
ancestry).

Candidates that would fail, and why: suite-count consistency and date validity
are numbers, which is the forbidden class; issue and PR links need the network,
breaking the deterministic-local guarantee; "does this summary match the diff"
is judgement, not falsifiable.

`validate(repo, text, in_archive=...)` iterates the registry. The caller says
what the document IS and the registry decides which rules follow - replacing a
`check_live_claims` boolean that forced every caller to know the rule list and
would have needed a second boolean for the next rule.

## Rule scoping, and why each answer differs

### Live claims - newest entry only

First version checked the whole file and fired on an entry that honestly stated
its own past status was "retained as written history". That is a false positive
on self-describing prose, and it is how a validator loses trust.

Narrowing to the newest entry is principled, not a patch: a present-tense status
is only meaningful for the current entry. Older entries are historical by
construction.

**Second half of the same fix:** the rule originally required the named branch to
BOTH exist and be merged. Projects that delete branches after merging made the
motivating defect - a false "not yet merged" about shipped work - structurally
undetectable. A claim naming a branch that no longer exists is now flagged too.

### Merge claims - whole file, including the archive

The opposite scope, for a real reason. "Merged at X" is a permanent claim about
the past: it should hold in any entry at any age. A stale "still outstanding"
claim costs a reader redundant work; a false "merged" claim tells them work
landed when it did not, so they build on nothing.

Archiving does not make a false factual claim true, so the archive is checked.

### Path pointers - operative use only

Measured before implementing: **23 of 88 path-shaped tokens did not exist, and
all 23 were legitimate** - completed-phase layout descriptions, deferred work
never built, files explicitly described as deleted. A shape-keyed rule would have
emitted 23 false positives on its first run.

Keyed on operative markers (`Plan:`, `Design:`, `see`, `read`) it emits none, and
still catches the defect that motivated it.

### References - whole file, backticked and bare

A dead reference is worthless regardless of age. Both styles must be checked:
a whole-branch review found 14 dead **bare** SHAs in documents the validator had
already certified clean, because only backticked tokens were being examined.

**Detection and repair must use the same tokenizer.** They did not, once: the
validator scanned per line while the translator scanned whole-text, and because
backticks pair across newlines the two drifted out of phase on **402 tokens**.
The validator reported dead SHAs the repairer was structurally unable to fix.

## Known limits, found by adversarial probing

An adversarial pass, now 18 probes wide, leaves three standing. They are
recorded because an undisclosed limit is indistinguishable from an unknown one:
the harness prints each of these as a flagged observation on every run, and a
flag with nothing written down here would read as a fresh defect every time.

**Claim deletion passes.** The validator compares claims against git; it cannot
compare a document against its own previous version. Deleting the offending
sentence is therefore always a way through. Mitigated only at the workflow
level, by the anti-gaming rules below.

**A user-supplied regex can hang.** Configuration accepts patterns, and Python's
`re` has no timeout, so a catastrophically backtracking pattern spins. The blast
radius is the author's own repository and the fix is to simplify the pattern,
but a hang is a worse failure mode than an error and is worth knowing about.

**A consistency check can name the same file twice and always agree.** The
check rejects a single-file block, because comparing a file against itself
proves nothing, and it normalises paths so `docs/x.md` and `docs/./x.md` are
caught as one file under two spellings. What it cannot catch is the same file
reached by genuinely different routes, a symlink or a case variant on a
case-insensitive filesystem. Such a block passes forever while appearing to
compare two things. The two-file minimum catches the obvious shape and not this
one.

**Fenced code is exempt from claim rules but not from the secret scan.** These
pull in opposite directions on purpose. An example in a fence is not a promise,
so claims there are ignored; a credential in a fence is still committed, so the
secret scan reads everything. Inline backticks are treated differently again:
kept for claim rules, because claims are written inside them, and blanked for
link rules, because an example link is written inside them too.

**One rule reads inside fences, and the exception is instructive.** The
exemption above cost this project two broken instructions before it was
qualified. A README pinned `rev: v0.5.0` for a fortnight while the repository
had no tags at all, and a Claude Code install line named a plugin id that never
existed. Both sat in fenced blocks. `dead-release-tag` is the rule for the
first and could not see it, by design.

The distinction the exemption was missing: a fence usually holds an EXAMPLE,
which is not a promise, but an install snippet is the one block on a page a
reader copies verbatim. It is closer to a promise than ordinary prose is.

`dead-pinned-ref` therefore reads inside code and asks only the narrowest
answerable question: does the version pinned for THIS repository resolve? The
governing `repo:` line is what keeps it honest, because a project documenting a
third-party hook pins a tag living in somebody else's repository, and checking
that would report a finding on a correct line. Measured before it was written:
three pins in this corpus, all resolving, no false positives.

## Anti-gaming

**The subagent gets at most 2 validation attempts and must report its FIRST-run
findings even if a later attempt cleared them.** Without this, the cheapest way
to pass a validator is to delete the offending claim. With it, claim-deletion is
visible in both the report and the diff.

**A red test suite must not block the status commit.** An entry that can only
describe green states withholds the truth exactly when it matters most.

**The archive must be validated.** Otherwise `--archive` shrinks the validation
surface and the tool passes its own gate by relocating content - the same defect
as a subagent deleting a claim, committed by the tool itself.

## Archive ordering

Archive **after** drafting the new entry, not before. Archiving first means the
new entry does not count toward the retention cap, so the document holds one more
entry than allowed and the archive runs permanently one cycle behind.

That fix immediately exposed the next one: the newly-archived entry then tripped
the live-claim rule, because "newest entry" in the archive is simply the most
recently retired one. Hence the archive's exemption from live-claim checking, and
only that rule.

## Conservation

The archive split is the only irreversible file operation. It asserts line
conservation with **multiset** arithmetic, not set membership - a set check
cannot detect the loss of a duplicated line, because one surviving copy satisfies
it.

The baseline for that check is the raw file bytes, **not** a reassembly of the
splitter's own output. Deriving it from the splitter makes the check circular: a
bug in the splitter corrupts both sides equally and they always agree.

## `raw-lfs-blob`: Git LFS, and the direction that had to be refused

`.gitattributes` is a document making a falsifiable claim: files matching these
patterns are stored as LFS pointers. That claim can be false, and when it is,
nothing says so. Git accepts the commit, the engine loads the asset, and the
repository carries a real binary in its history forever.

Two directions look identical and only one is usable.

**A path under an LFS filter stored as a raw blob** is answerable from git
alone: `check-attr` says what the filter governs, and the pointer header says
how it is stored. No network, and the LFS binary is never invoked.

**A pointer whose object is missing locally** cannot be a rule. Measured: a
fresh CI checkout without `git lfs pull` holds ZERO objects, so that check
would report every asset in the project as missing on every run. It is the
false-positive class this project treats as worse than having no validator.

Both of this rule's bugs were invisible in its output, which is why it has more
mutations than any other. Paths were piped to `check-attr` with `text=True`, so
Windows appended a carriage return to each, git read it as a literal path
character, and answered `unspecified` for all but the LAST path. The survey
reported 1 of 4 governed files, and the one that survived happened to be the
one with the finding - so the rule looked perfect. Had the bad file sorted
first it would have printed a clean result over an examined count of zero.

It also read `git ls-files`, the index, which is empty on a repository whose
checkout has not completed. On a real Unity project that meant zero examined
while `.gitattributes` sat there declaring 47 LFS patterns. It reads HEAD's
tree now, which is also the right semantics: this runs after a commit, so the
committed state is what is being judged.

And one subprocess per file cost 40 seconds on a 7802-file project. That is not
a slow hook, it is an uninstalled one. Sizes come from one `cat-file
--batch-check`, contents from one `cat-file --batch`, and only for blobs small
enough to BE a pointer: 262 ms.

## The game-engine presets, and the widening that was measured and refused

The plan was to widen `path_pointer` with asset and source extensions. Measured
against a real Unity project and a real shipped Godot game, that rule examines
ZERO references in either. Game documentation writes paths as markdown links -
`[ART_NOTES.md](Documentation/ART_NOTES.md)` - and `path_pointer` requires a
BACKTICKED path introduced by an operative marker. Widening it would have been
a no-op that looked like a feature. Neither preset touches it.

`dead-md-link` is what carries these projects and needed no change: 257 links
examined across the two, one reported, and that one is a genuine bug - a README
linking to `/doc` with a leading slash, which GitHub resolves to the site root,
while every other link in the same file uses the relative form.

The version checks are keyed on different documents per engine, because that is
where each project actually states it. Unity puts its editor version in a
shields.io badge carrying the exact `6000.0.52f1`, matching
`ProjectVersion.txt`; its prose two paragraphs later says only "6000.0 LTS", so
a check keyed there needs major.minor on both sides and would miss a drift from
`.52f1` to `.61f1`. Thrive's README states no Godot version at all, so that
check reads `doc/setup_instructions.md` instead - keyed on the README it would
have examined nothing forever while exiting 0.

There is no `unreal` preset, deliberately: no corpus was measured for it, and
`EngineAssociation` in a `.uproject` holds a GUID rather than a version for any
studio on a custom engine build, so the obvious check would false-positive on
exactly the teams most likely to want this.

## Integration branches, and why one trunk was not enough

Three rules used to ask "is X an ancestor of trunk", and they meant three
different things by it. On a repository with two integration branches each
answer was wrong, in a different direction, at the same time.

Measured on a gitflow fixture - main and develop, a release branch merged to
both and tagged, a feature merged to develop after that release:

- with `trunk = main`, a FALSE claim about develop was not judged wrong, it was
  never examined. The pattern interpolated the trunk name, so the line did not
  match at all. Two false claims in one document, one about each branch, and
  either setting caught exactly one.
- with `trunk = develop`, a genuinely shipped `v1.0.0` was reported dead. The
  tag sits on main's release merge; develop received the release BRANCH back,
  not that commit.

**A merge claim names its own ref, so that is what is checked.** "Merged to
`X` at `Y`" is self-describing, and asking git whether Y is on X needs no
configuration at all. This is strictly MORE precise than comparing against one
trunk, which is what makes it the right answer rather than a loosening: a
trunk *list* would have made the rule ask "an ancestor of any of these", which
trends toward `dead-sha` wearing another rule's name.

The two rules that cannot name a ref use a measured set: the configured trunk
plus whichever of `main`, `master`, `develop`, `development`, `trunk` exist.

**Not a shape rule.** The first version asked only whether a branch name had a
slash in it, reasoning that topic branches are prefixed and long-lived ones are
bare. That is true of the prefixes and useless in reverse: an existing test
cuts a tag on a branch called `abandoned`, and the shape rule promoted it to an
integration branch and reported the release as shipped. Every `gh-pages`,
`experiment` or `old-master` is the same trap. The narrower list degrades
safely, because the rule this all exists for does not consult it.

**A missing branch is not a false claim.** Gitflow deletes every release and
feature branch on merge, and a squash merge or a custom `-m` erases the name
from history, so neither `rev-parse` nor the merge-message rescue can tell
"deleted" from "invented". Reporting those produced a false positive on the
fixture. The rule asks the substantive question instead: a missing branch plus
an integrated commit is a stale name on a claim that is true, and silence is
right; a missing branch plus a commit on no integration branch is a claim that
work landed when it did not. This also keeps the rule from being defeated by a
typo, since evading it requires the commit to be genuinely integrated - at
which point there is no false claim left to hide.

**Backticks decide whether an unresolvable name is reported.** The pattern no
longer anchors on a known branch name, so it can match a word of prose sitting
where a branch would go. `` merged to `develp` at `abc` `` is a claim about a
specific branch; "merged to production at `abc`" is not necessarily one.
Requiring backticks outright would lose every project that writes the name
bare, so both match and only the backticked form is accused.

**The installer writes its own `merge_claim`, and that is the line that
matters.** The generated pattern overrides the default, so a collector that
supports named refs still ships single-trunk behaviour if the installer
regresses. That is exactly what happened during this change: every unit test
passed, because they exercise the default, and the gitflow scenario caught it
because it runs the real installer.

## The baseline, and the two things it deliberately does not do

A baseline is an amnesty: a list of findings a project has agreed to leave
broken so that NEW ones stay visible. Every design question about it is
whether that amnesty can quietly grow to cover everything, so the constraints
matter more than the suppression does.

It is never written implicitly, the suppressed count is printed on every run,
`--baseline-check` reports entries whose finding no longer occurs, and a
corrupt or missing baseline is an error rather than an empty one. That last
point is the important one: treating a missing file as "suppress nothing"
would let a typo'd path turn a ratcheted run back into an ordinary one without
saying so.

Two consequences are accepted rather than fixed, and the smoke harness flags
both on every run so they stay visible rather than becoming folklore.

**A baseline can suppress a live credential.** `possible-secret` is treated as
ordinary debt, so a token still sitting in the document is silenced by the same
mechanism that forgives a dead link. Every other rule describes something that
is merely wrong; this one describes something that is still dangerous. It is
not special-cased because a secret that is genuinely a false positive - an
example key, a test fixture, a documented placeholder - is common enough that
an unsuppressable rule would push projects to disable the scanner entirely,
which is worse. The mitigation is that the finding detail is recorded
TRUNCATED, so the baseline file cannot become a committed secret store.

**One recorded finding forgives every future copy of itself.** The fingerprint
is `(path, kind, detail)` and deliberately excludes the line number, so the
same claim pasted somewhere new in the same file is already forgiven. The
alternative is worse: line-number fingerprints un-suppress the entire baseline
on any reflow, which makes the file useless within a week and teaches people
to regenerate it wholesale, which defeats the point of having one.

## Authoring constraints these rules impose

- **Paraphrase past statuses in the newest entry; never quote or strike them
  through.** The rules cannot distinguish a quotation from a claim.
- Write SHA ranges as `` `a` `` -> `` `b` ``, not `` `a -> b` ``. A range inside one
  backtick pair is not recognised as a reference and escapes both checking and
  repair.
- Give each entry the exact configured header. A wrong header silently disables
  archiving and live-claim validation for that entry.
